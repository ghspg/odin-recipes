    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>“This is one of Emilia-Romagna’s typical dishes. It’s not the classic version (with pork loin, one egg, butter and sometimes white wine), but a variation taken from the area between Modena and Reggio Emilia. The rezdore of Emilia used to do the sfoglia by hand, but now they use a food processor. ”</p>

    <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>300 g beef brisket</li>
        <li>150 g beef shank bones</li>
        <li>300 g free-range chicken thighs and drumsticks, skin on</li>
        <li>½ an onion</li>
        <li>1 stick of celery</li>
        <li>1 carrot</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Ingredients (Pasta Dough):</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>200 g tipo 00 flour, plus extra for dusting</li>
        <li>2 large free-range eggs</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Ingredients (Filling):</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>olive oil</li>
        <li>75 g lean minced beef</li>
        <li>75 g higher-welfare prosciutto di Parma</li>
        <li>50 g higher-welfare mortadella di Bologna</li>
        <li>1 pinch of ground nutmeg</li>
        <li>50 g Parmesan cheese, plus extra to serve</li>    
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Steps:</h2>

    <ol>
        <li>First, make a stock. Put the beef brisket, bones, chicken, unpeeled onion and celery in a large stockpot. Halve the carrot lengthways, and add to the pan with a pinch of sea salt.</li>
        <li>Pour over 2 litres of cold water, or enough to cover. Bring to the boil, then cover and simmer for 4 hours, skimming occasionally.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, prepare the pasta dough. Blend the ingredients in a food processor (or combine by hand) until they come together and you have a soft but firm dough. Lightly dust with flour, wrap in clingfilm and leave to rest for 30 minutes.</li>
        <li>For the filling, heat a little oil in a saucepan, season the mince and fry until cooked through. Drain any water and leave to cool.</li>
        <li>Transfer to a food processor with the prosciutto, mortadella and nutmeg. Finely grate in the Parmesan, then blitz (or finely chop together by hand) until you have a very fine mixture.</li>
        <li>You’ll need to make the pasta in stages so it doesn’t dry out. Divide the dough into 8 pieces. Use a pasta machine (or a floured rolling pin) to roll out 1 piece (covering the rest with clingfilm or a tea towel ) into a long, flat, very thin 6cm-wide strip. Slice into 3cm squares.</li>
        <li>To make the tortellini, lightly dust a tray with flour. Place a ¼ of a teaspoon of filling in the middle of a square of pasta.</li>
        <li>Fold the pasta over into a triangle, and press at the edges to seal. Wind the folded edge around the tip of your middle finger and press the ends to form a ring.</li>
        <li>Continue until you have used all the rolled-out dough, then roll the next piece and keep going until it’s all used up. You can make meatballs or ragù with any leftover filling.</li>
        <li>To serve, strain the stock and discard the meat and vegetables. Taste and adjust the salt, if it’s necessary</li>
        <li>Bring to the boil, add the tortellini and cook for about 3 minutes, or till they rise to the surface. Ladle into bowls and serve with extra Parmesan.</li>
    </ol>
